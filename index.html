    <h2>SKILLS SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
        My journey into the world of technology began at a young age, fueled by curiosity and a desire
        to understand how things work. Although I pursued a degree in Biochemistry, I have a strong understanding
        of programming, algorithms, and system design. In my professional life, I have worked in diverse roles
        ranging from software development to IT consulting.
